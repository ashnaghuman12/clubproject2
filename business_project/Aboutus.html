<h4>About Us</h4>

<h5>Commenced in 2017, Strive for Girls was created for the go-getters aspiring to make a change in the gender issues occuring in the STEM fields. Through sisterhood and community we are able to accomplish much more than we can imagine.  </h5>
In early 2017, we had a vision to bring awareness to the girls in our school about the lack of gender equality in thr STEM field. We were encouraged to start our club after realizing that we need to influence and mentor other girls
